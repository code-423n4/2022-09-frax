i am sure that this is a dumb question, but the contracts we should audit are under ,,src" right?


[08/13/2022 2:18 PM] JohnSmith#1623
Contracts in scope are in "Contracts Under Review" section

[08/14/2022 12:54 PM] drakeevansv1
Yes it’s great!! Although much better to use console2.log for foundry 😉


[08/14/2022 5:15 PM] devtooligan
whats the benefit of console2?


[08/14/2022 5:50 PM] drakeevansv1
It prints nicer messages in the output, give it a try its a big improvement but only works with foundry.  Whereas console.log will work with hardhat tests as well i believe.


[08/14/2022 7:38 PM] devtooligan
🤔 hmm looks same to me lol

[08/14/2022 8:28 PM] drakeevansv1
Are there specific issues that you would like more info on?  All of the known issues are by design. I believe most are due to configuration other than  the exchange rate overflow and the low borrow balance.


[08/14/2022 8:31 PM] reassor#7970
Just trying to figure out how to approach it, since it was not specified if its a bug that you are planning to fix or you just accept it.

[08/16/2022 10:35 AM] elku.cryptos
so i did `npm install` and `forge build`. what would be my next command for running forge tests?


[08/16/2022 10:46 AM] illilli000
`npx hardhat compile && source .env && forge test --fork-url $MAINNET_URL --fork-block-number $DEFAULT_FORK_BLOCK`


[08/16/2022 10:46 AM] illilli000
assuming you created and filled `.env` already


[08/16/2022 10:47 AM] elku.cryptos
we arent using foundry for testing?


[08/16/2022 10:47 AM] elku.cryptos
ah never mind..


[08/16/2022 10:47 AM] illilli000
it's best to follow the commands that the sponsor provides in the order that they provide, so everyone is doing the same thing and different envs don't have to be debugged

{Reactions}
👍 

[08/16/2022 10:53 AM] elku.cryptos
these 3 doesnt need to be edited right?
```
DEFAULT_FORK_BLOCK=15001901

## Always consider these compromised
MNEMONIC=
PRIVATE_KEY=
```
only mainnet and polygon mainnet url's are needed?


[08/16/2022 10:54 AM] illilli000
actually, instructions say to fill in mnemonic


[08/16/2022 10:55 AM] illilli000
you can use:
`MNEMONIC="test test test test test test test test test test test junk"`


[08/16/2022 10:58 AM] elku.cryptos
```
source .env && forge test --fork-url $MAINNET_URL --fork-block-number $DEFAULT_FORK_BLOCK
: command not found
error: Invalid value "15001901\r" for '--fork-block-number <BLOCK>': invalid digit found in string

For more information try --help
```


[08/16/2022 10:59 AM] illilli000
are you on windows? try going to the end of the DEFAULT_FORK_BLOCK line, deleting all the digits, re-add them, and press enter


[08/16/2022 10:59 AM] illilli000
and save and try again


[08/16/2022 11:03 AM] elku.cryptos
yes. i am on windows.. 😅 
re-adding them didnt work, but i placed the whole line at the end of the file and its running now. thanks a lot for the help man.

I keep encountering this error:
```
$ git submodule update --recursive --remote
fatal: Needed a single revision
Unable to find current origin/master revision in submodule path 'lib/ERC4626'
```
I get it with that individual command, but also if I do the all-in-one command:
```
Cloning into '/home/respx/C4/2022-09-frax/lib/solmate'...
fatal: Needed a single revision
Unable to find current origin/master revision in submodule path 'lib/ERC4626'

[09/23/2022 10:51 PM] travisfraxfinance33
hmm


[09/23/2022 10:51 PM] travisfraxfinance33
Do you have any submodules currently there?


[09/23/2022 10:51 PM] travisfraxfinance33
It shouldnt need to be in tip-top updated state


[09/23/2022 10:52 PM] travisfraxfinance33
you can also cd into the submodule and `git pull` I think


[09/23/2022 10:52 PM] .respx
With the all-in-one there is nothing there before I run the command.


[09/23/2022 10:53 PM] travisfraxfinance33

Have you tried from scratch with the individual steps instead of the all-in-one?


[09/23/2022 10:54 PM] travisfraxfinance33
if you are just starting, you need to make sure to have the submodule commands when cloning.
```git clone https://github.com/FraxFinance/frxETH-public.git --recurse-submodules --remote-submodules```


[09/23/2022 10:57 PM] .respx
Okay, I cleaned it all out and ran your command, @Travis | Frax Finance (¤³, ¤³). It gave that error when running your command.


[09/23/2022 10:58 PM] travisfraxfinance33
Weird. I just ran it in an empty test folder and worked fine


[09/23/2022 10:59 PM] travisfraxfinance33
hmm


[09/23/2022 11:00 PM] illilli000
maybe there's some envvar set in your env? try a fresh xterm


[09/23/2022 11:01 PM] travisfraxfinance33
Most of the envars are used in the tests. He should be able to clone with no .env file at all


[09/23/2022 11:02 PM] travisfraxfinance33
I am on Ubuntu 20.04, what are you on


[09/23/2022 11:03 PM] illilli000
no, I meant wardens often do the cloning into the same directory for every sponsor, and perhaps there was some leftover envvar from a previous contest


[09/23/2022 11:03 PM] travisfraxfinance33
Could be his personal git setup


[09/23/2022 11:04 PM] .respx
I'm using a WSL Ubuntu here.


[09/23/2022 11:04 PM] .respx

@Respx try this and maybe manually add in the submodules one by one


[09/23/2022 11:05 PM] travisfraxfinance33
make sure to target /lib and not .


[09/23/2022 11:34 PM] .respx
I've switched to a different computer (Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS) but I am getting precisely the same issues and behaviours. `git submodule update --init --recursive --remote` always produces that error. I can run the commands from stackoverflow, but none of them fix that behaviour. My lib directory never has the same pattern of updates as your screenshot shows. Right now it is SSSM. If I proceed with commands, I fail at `forge build` with lots of `Compiler run failed
 error[6275]: ParserError: Source ... not found`


[09/23/2022 11:35 PM] travisfraxfinance33
Is foundry installed?


[09/23/2022 11:35 PM] .respx
yes


[09/23/2022 11:37 PM] travisfraxfinance33
1) `mkdir lib`
2) `git submodule add https://github.com/fei-protocol/ERC4626 ./lib`


[09/23/2022 11:38 PM] .respx
I just got the tests to run, weirdly. It happened by adding `openzeppelin-contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/` to the end of `remappings.txt`.

[09/23/2022 11:38 PM] .respx
I did that without running your command, Travis.


[09/23/2022 11:53 PM] illilli000
what made you decide to try that? that remapping was already in remappings.txt


[09/23/2022 11:54 PM] .respx
Not in mine. `forge build` was failing and reported that it could not find the oz files. It seemed to be missing the `lib`


[09/23/2022 11:59 PM] travisfraxfinance33
If remappings was missing, that would have indeed caused issues


[09/24/2022 10:05 AM] w0Lfrum#0078
When "forge test --fork-url $FORK_URL -vv" is run, I got an environment variable not found error. Is there a way to "export" all the environment variables in the .env file in one go?


[09/24/2022 10:07 AM] w0Lfrum#0078
Is there a way around this?

[09/24/2022 10:14 AM] illilli000
If you're running with the alchemy command, that's the only one that needs to be exported - all others should come from the .env file


[09/24/2022 10:17 AM] w0Lfrum#0078
I've already run 
export FORK_URL="https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/{...}"
and I've also added FORK_URL="https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/{...}" in the .env file


[09/24/2022 10:22 AM] illilli000
my url looks like this: `https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/xxxxx` so are you sure you are using the right one?


[09/24/2022 10:24 AM] w0Lfrum#0078
I just used curly braces instead of the xxxx just for showing the rpc url here
The curly braces got converted to %7B and %7D somehow


[09/24/2022 10:25 AM] w0Lfrum#0078
I'm sure I used the right RPC URL


[09/24/2022 10:25 AM] illilli000
alchemyapi.io, not g.alchemy.com


[09/24/2022 10:27 AM] illilli000
and I don't think there are curly braces...


[09/24/2022 10:30 AM] illilli000
it looks like they've updated the url domain since last I checked, but like I said, I don't think there should be curly braces in the key


[09/24/2022 10:31 AM] illilli000
did you try the non-alchemy all-in-one?


[09/24/2022 10:33 AM] w0Lfrum#0078
It's given as ".com"

[09/24/2022 10:38 AM] w0Lfrum#0078
No no, what I meant to say is that just for the purpose of hiding the API key part of the alchemy link, I had replaced it with {...} before posting it publicly on discord.
But for the commands that I ran on my terminal, for those I used the correct alchemy https link.


[09/24/2022 10:38 AM] illilli000
ok, got it. please try the non-alchemy all-in-one


[09/24/2022 11:04 AM] illilli000
@w0Lfrum did it work?


[09/24/2022 11:06 AM] w0Lfrum#0078
I did tried the default ankr all-in-one, but I still got the same "environment variable not found" error for the foundry tests


[09/24/2022 11:07 AM] illilli000
are you on windows?


[09/24/2022 11:07 AM] w0Lfrum#0078
I think it might have to do with me using the windows OS


[09/24/2022 11:07 AM] w0Lfrum#0078
Yep


[09/24/2022 11:08 AM] illilli000
oh ok, yeah, sorry, I don't have a windows env where I can debug things like this


[09/24/2022 11:09 AM] w0Lfrum#0078

coverage of the tests. 10% = 10% of the lines of code in that file are being run through in some test in the test suite

{Reactions}
thankyou (2) 

[09/25/2022 3:35 AM] neko_nyaa
How do you cover 6.8 lines?


[09/25/2022 4:10 AM] carrotsmuggler
the sloc listed here and the test module probably counts lines of code differently


[09/25/2022 5:13 AM] pfapostol
maybe it counts functions and other symbols


[09/25/2022 6:58 AM] illilli000
sloc will count curly braces, whereas since curly braces aren't executable statements, they don't count when doing coverage


[09/25/2022 6:58 AM] illilli000
if you hover over the coverage number with your mouse, it will show you the number of lines it counted

{Reactions}
thankyou 

[09/25/2022 9:57 AM] road220
btw, do I need to somehow specify remappings.txt when `forge build --force` like in hh? Idk, but it tries to search for oz imports in `./` which is a bit weird


[09/25/2022 9:59 AM] illilli000
some windows users are having an issue with oz, and while there's a workaround https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/1006962351754453182/1023015534889009162 the underlying reason hasn't been determined


[09/25/2022 9:59 AM] road220
i'm on linux


[09/25/2022 10:00 AM] illilli000
is the all-in-one command not working for you?


[09/25/2022 10:05 AM] road220
Actually, I've checked the whole thread https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/1006962351754453182/1023019566516944906. Thx, i'll try to add manually, since I've also spent about hour on that


[09/25/2022 10:06 AM] illilli000
the all-in-one is there to save you time, but if you figure out the oz issue, let us know!


[09/25/2022 10:13 AM] road220
ohh, I get the reason behind such behavior. 

lib/oz-contracts/contracts/contracts/...

just try to remove extra /contracts in remappings

Btw might be a little late but running `source .env && forge test --fork-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL -vv` gives me "environment variable not found"


[09/25/2022 10:25 AM] neko_nyaa
I simply rename `SAMPLE.env` into `.env`

nice name, bro!


[10/28/2022 2:43 PM] .satyam_
does this contest payout get credit to the individual address??


[10/29/2022 12:57 AM] yongkiws
yes, i think 1-2 weeks distributions


[10/29/2022 4:23 AM] .satyam_
Yes it's 2nd week running


[10/29/2022 2:26 PM] .satyam_
any update of award distribution this was my first contest that's why i'm  little concern


[10/29/2022 4:50 PM] find_a_bug
Thanks @chaduke ! It's definitely possible. Especially with gas optimization bugs. The nice thing is I did it just out of curiosity and expected $2 payout. When I saw $21 my heart almost stopped beating lol

in the next contests a scoring threshold will be introduced and low quality gas/qa reports will not be profitable.

@pfapostol Yeah, I know. The best thing to do is play for the long game and the deeper bugs. I'm not in that level yet, but it's a goal of mine.

2 weeks is an expected time, sometimes the payouts may come later, so there is no need to panic before 2 weeks.

Payout is so delayed! Their should be a feature on c4 to track the payouts of different completed contest , tracking them becomes easy for wardens to guess how many days are left for payout initiated in this way neither do warden get worried about payout nor do c4 staff get any issue regarding payouts.
Like Amazon delivery tracking features 🙃

A feature that plays into this feature where payouts get send every Friday where the payouts round up for the previous weeks contests awards from Thursday to the next week Wednesday and then on the Friday of the Wednesday cut off date payouts for those 5 days get send. (c4 timezone)

That way there's 5 days for awards to be announced and added to the list of distribution and also 2 days regardless of what happens that payouts can be made sure of and next week the same happens with zero exceptions unless there is some direct issue with payout from the sponsors side etc. and if there is an issue in the short term wardens get notified, maybe in a format that Satyam suggested turning the C4 profile on the website into a back office of some sort 🙂

I get the 1 - 2 week period and that's great but I can see how it can get a bit crazy with multiple contests getting awarded over a given time especially this time around with multiple awards awaiting distribution.

Not sure if there's automation on distribution yet either but this will greatly simplify future automation and distribution.


[11/05/2022 8:45 AM] a12jmx
Or make it every 2 weeks Friday. That way there's 12 days for awards to be announce and added to list of distribution (not accounting for public holidays) and instead of stating 1 - 2 weeks for distribution, the Friday it will get distributed exact date gets initiated.

So as an example, excluding the distribution of current awards awaiting distribution, 

if we take it from this past Thursday that would mean from Thursday 03 Nov - Wednesday 16 Nov all contest awards that gets announced in this time frame gets distributed on Friday 18 Nov and then the same happens from Thursday 17 Nov - 30 Nov for distribution on Friday 02 Dec etc

Only exception will be above mentioned and ofcourse the Friday falling on a public holiday where the awards then can be distributed the next Monday or Tuesday (if not fully automated) not affecting the other 2 week awards


[11/05/2022 9:22 AM] .satyam_
yes i agree with u on this. fix the exact date and day to get the payout initiated so that the warden does not get hesitate by asking when the payouts get initiated multiple time's Like me🙃  But yes many things occur in c4 is mannually type and some time payouts and things specifically get delayed so for this c4 stuff should notify wardens in advance because many c4 wardens do their contest for the 1st time and they get worried like why my payouts do not initiated does i given the wrong wallet address? and many dilemma they get faced..


[11/05/2022 10:44 AM] pfapostol
maybe the best way is to just stop asking every day when the payout is, and just wait.

I received it. I didn't know it's in USDC. If someone is new here like me, apart from adding polygon to metamask, you also have to import the usdc token.
